Basílica de la Sagrada Família

The Basilica

The Temple Expiatori de la Sagrada Família (Expiatory Temple of the Holy Family) is considered to be the symbol of Barcelona. Initially intended to be a simple Roman Catholic church dedicated to Jesus, Mary and Joseph, the church ultimately became the most prominent example of Catalan Modernism. Pope Benedict XVI declared it a basilica in 2010.

Dreamed up by Catalan architect Antoni Gaudí, the basilica exemplifies Gaudí’s philosophy that nature is the work of God. Gaudí sought to combine Christian speech and biblical allegories with complex natural symbols like organic, geometric shapes which are prominent in every column, pinnacle and stained glass window of the basilica.

The Architect

Antoni Gaudí was born on 25 June 1852 in Reus, then the second-largest city in Catalonia. He went to primary school at Escoles Pies, where he excelled in geometry and arithmetic and received a traditional religious education in the humanities. The son of a potsmith, he began learning the trade in his father's workshop in 1860. He spent his childhood in Reus and the neighbouring town of Riudoms, at his father's family farmhouse, where he observed close up what would become a guiding reference throughout his life: nature.
